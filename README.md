# Predicting Toxic Compound Concentrations in Air Pollution Particles
Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a widespread class of environmental chemical pollutant known to have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in humans and other living beings. 

In this work, we develop a machine learning model to predict concentrations of 16 PAHs in soot samples obtained from combustion of different fuels at different conditions. 

We use principal component regression (PCR) (Gaurav Mahamuni - "EEM Mixing Samples.ipynb", "PCA Py3 Mixed.ipynb")

The average test error using PCR is 34%.
